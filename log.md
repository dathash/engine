BUGS
Alpha is determined by order of draws. Is there a solution?
-pitch has a gimbal lock problem with reflections when we hit 45.
Swap the camera implementation out for a quaternion one to fix it.
Can't select properly while in fbo mode.
* We need to read pixels from the render buffer, which for some reason eludes me.
